Questions, or additional information sources (blog pages etc.) that you would like to read, and we hope you will also get ideas for places where you would like to test what you have learnt. Put these into a course backlog document (it will help if you put them in a roughly prioritised order), and then spend time during each sprint to resolve your backlog items.

At the end of the course, it is our hope that your backlog contains pointers to yourself with how you should go forward with the knowledge gained. For example, are there any particularly interesting things you have found that you would like to study more? Are there any courses you are interested in taking as a consequence of taking this course? Are there any practices that you would like to introduce into your organisation? How?

Order the items in your course backlog according to your needs and priorities.

The course backlog is revisited in every sprint. We will not mark it; you create it for your own benefit.
